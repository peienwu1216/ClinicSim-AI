Abstract
In the assessment of chest pain patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the emergency
department (ED), physicians rely on global diagnostic impressions ( ‘gestalt ’). The aim of this study was to determine
the diagnostic value of the ED physician ’s overall assessment of ACS likelihood, and the values of the main
diagnostic modalities underlying this assessment, namely the chest pain history, the ECG and the initial troponin
result. 1,151 consecutive ED chest pain patients were prospectively included. The ED physician ’s interpretation of
the chest pain history, the ECG, and the global likelihood of ACS were recorded on special forms. The discharge
diagnoses were retrieved from the medical records. A chart review was carried out to determine whether patients
with a non-ACS diagnosis at the index visit had ACS or suffered cardiac death within 30 days. The gestalt was better
than its components both at ruling in ( “Obvious ACS ”, LR 29) and at ruling out ( “No Suspicion of ACS ”, LR 0.01) ACS.
In the “Strong suspicion of ACS ”group, 60% of the patients did not have ACS. A positive TnT (LR 24.9) and an
ischemic ECG (LR 8.3) were strong predictors of ACS and seemed superior to pain history for ruling in ACS. In
patients with a normal TnT and non-ischemic ECG, chest pain history typical of AMI was not a significant predictor
of AMI (LR 1.9) while pain history typical of unstabl ea n g i n a( U A )w a sam o d e r a t ep r e d i c t o ro fU A( L R4 . 7 ) .

Background
Non-traumatic chest pain is a common presenting com-
plaint among patients seeking care in the Emergency
Department (ED). The management of these patients
often hinges upon the perceived likelihood that an acute
coronary syndrome (ACS) accounts for the patient ’s
chest pain. A substantial proportion of patients with
chest pain are admitted for inpatient care in order torule-out ACS, and many undergo stress testing, of which
only a small proportion are abnormal and lead to a
change in management (Penumetsa et al. 2012). These
admissions and investigations in patients without ACS
cause a substantial health care burden (Goodacre et al.
2005). At the same time, 2-4% of patients with ACS are
erroneously discharged from the ED (Lee et al. 1987;
Pope et al. 2000). These patients have a higher mortality
than patients with ACS who are admitted, further em-
phasizing the need for an improved assessment of the
likelihood of ACS in the emergency department (Lee
et al. 1987; Pope et al. 2000).
The main tools used to determine the likelihood of
ACS in the ED are the chest pain history, the ECG and* Correspondence: arash_x.mokhtari@med.lu.se

blood markers of myocardial injury such as troponins.
The predictive values for ACS of these diagnostic
methods have been extensively analyzed (Chun and
McGee 2004; Panju et al. 1998; Swap and Nagurney
2005; Lee et al. 1985), but the studies have mostly fo-
cused on single items (e.g. radiation to the arms) and on
diagnosing acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and not
ACS. Single items are insufficient predictors of ACS for
the purpose of ED decision-making (Swap and Nagurney
2005), and a number of clinical prediction rules combin-
ing items have therefore been developed (Christenson
et al. 2006; Fesmire et al. 2012; Hess et al. 2012; Six
et al. 2008). However, the value of these prediction rules
in ED routine care has not yet been established (Hess
et al. 2008; Manini et al. 2009; Steurer et al. 2010). Most
clinicians instead rely on a global, subjective patient
assessment known as ‘gestalt. ’Studies have demon-
strated that the clinical gestalt for pulmonary embolism
performs at least as well as clinical prediction rules
(Chunilal et al. 2003; Runyon et al. 2005; Penaloza et al.
2013). Also, the clinical gestalt for acute cholecystitis has
a high predictive accuracy even in the absence of indi-
vidual findings with high predictive power (Trowbridge
et al. 2003). The diagnostic accuracy of the clinical ge-
stalt for ACS is unclear.
Knowledge of the diagnostic accuracy of the gestalt
for ACS may help ED clinicians to make better deci-
sions when managing patients with chest pain. The

Methods
Study site
The Skåne University Hospital at Lund is a tertiary
care, 700 bed institution that serves as the primary
hospital for some 300,000 inhabitants. Percutaneous
coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery by-
pass surgery (CABG) are available 24 hours a day.
Roughly 65,000 patients are assessed every year in the
ED, of which about 5,500 present with non-traumatic
chest pain. There is no dedicated chest pain observa-
tion unit. Patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarc-
tion (STEMI) who are ident ified via ambulance ECGs
as a rule bypass the ED and are taken directly to the
angiography suite.
Patient population
All patients aged over 18 years who presented with non-
traumatic chest pain to the Lund ED during June 12th -
October 8th 2009 were prospectively identified andenrolled in the study. Patients were excluded from the
analysis if the history was unreliable due to e.g. alcohol
intoxication or dementia, if they were transferred to an-
other hospital, if they refused admission for inpatient
evaluation, or if data were missing.
Routine clinical assessment
All included patients were initially assessed by a triage
team that measured vital signs, recorded an ECG and
took routine blood tests including a troponin T (TnT).
The patients were then assessed by a resident or a
specialist in internal and/or emergency medicine.
This physician took a history, performed a physical
exam, and if necessary, reviewed the case with a se-
nior colleague.
Data collection
After the patient encounter, the physician or one of the
authors (MS) recorded the physician ’s assessment of the
patient on a specific study form (see Additional file 1).
The assessments were all made at the same time.
First, the physician categorized the chest pain history
astypical of AMI, typical of Unstable Angina (UA), non-
specific for ACS ,o r not suspicious of ACS . The form
specified that central, pressure-type pain lasting over
15 minutes with or without radiation to the arm or
shoulder is considered typical for AMI. Specifications
for the other categories were not provided. Next, the
physician noted the presence or absence of the following
ECG changes: a) ST-elevation or depression ≥1m mi na t
least two anatomically contiguous leads; b) left bundle
branch block (LBBB); c) pathological Q-waves in at least
two anatomically contiguous leads; d) T-wave inver-
sions in at least two anatomically contiguous leads. In
the present study, a non-ischemic ECG was defined as
an ECG lacking all of the findings above.
Last, physicians recorded their composite assessment of
the likelihood of ACS based on the chest pain history,
ECG and the first TnT value, which in principle was al-
ways available at the time of assessment. In order to limit
heterogeneity of the assessments, physicians had to choose
among four ACS likelihood levels, with suggested defini-
tions provided on the data form: Obvious ACS ,t y p i c a l
symptoms and ST-elevation or LBBB not previously
observed; Strong suspicion of ACS, a) typical symptoms or
b) ST-T changes or LBBB not previously observed, or
c) acute heart failure or hypotension regardless of ECG or
d) ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation or AV-block III; Low
suspicion of ACS, unclear symptoms and history, non-
ischemic ECG; and No suspicion of ACS ,a )n os u s p i c i o n
of ischemic heart disease, or b) stable angina pectoris. The
physicians were free to disregard these definitions, but the
definitions where non-controversial and reflected com-
mon clinical reasoning at the hospital during the study.Mokhtari et al. SpringerPlus  (2015) 4:219 Page 2 of 7
The troponin assay used in this study was Elecsys tropo-
nin T, which has a 99th percentile cutoff of 0.01 μg/L, and
with 0.03 μg/L reported as the lowest concentration with a
coefficient of variation ≤10%. The first TnT test result
was retrieved from the electronic patient records, with
values ≥0.05 μg/L being considered indicative of ACS.
Outcome measures
Patients admitted after the ED assessment were cared
for by ward physicians blinded to the data form. The
discharge diagnosis (ICD 10) was obtained from the
discharge summary, which was written by the ward
physician and reviewed for quality and accuracy by a
specialist in internal medicine and/or cardiology. For pa-
tients discharged from the ED, the discharge diagnosis
(ICD 10) was retrieved from the ED patient record writ-
ten by the responsible ED physician. Patients were con-
sidered to have ACS if they received the diagnosis in the
Skåne University Hospital ’s patient records, or suffered a
cardiac death during the index visit or within 30 days of
ED presentation. Those who received a non-ACS diag-
nosis at the index visit and were diagnosed with ACS
within 30-days were categorized as missed ACS.
Statistics and ethics
All measures of diagnostic performance (sensitivity, spe-
cificity, likelihood ratios) were calculated with ACS as
the outcome measure, except chest pain history assessed
as “typical of AMI ”and “typical of UA ”,where AMI and
UA were used as the respective outcome measures.
When a cell of a 2 x 2 table was 0, 0.5 was added to allcells before calculating likelihood ratios (LR) (Chun and
McGee 2004). Analyses were made using IBM SPSS
Statistics v19 and Microsoft Excel 2007. All included
patients gave informed consent in writing, and the study
was approved by the regional ethics committee in Lund
(DNR 2009/630).

Patient characteristics

study. Seventy-one patients w ere excluded based on prede-
fined criteria, leaving 1,151 patients in the final analysis.
The baseline characteristics of these patients are listed in
Table 1. The mean age was 61 years, 29% had a history of
coronary artery disease (CAD), and 15% had diabetes. Fifty-
four per cent of the patients were admitted for inpatient

population, 13% had a final diagnosis of ACS (97 AMI, 49
UA) during the index visit or within 30 days. In the
remaining patients, the most common causes of chest pain
were unspecified chest pain, musculoskeletal pain, and
stable angina. One case of AMI and four cases of UA were
missed according to our criteria, implying a 3.4% miss rate.
Diagnostic performance of cardiac risk factors
As can be seen in Table 2, age < 40 years almost ex-
cluded ACS (LR 0.02) while higher age increased the
ACS probability only slightly. A previous history of
CAD, peripheral artery disease (PAD), stroke and dia-
betes did not alter post-test probability of ACS.

Diagnostic performances of likelihood assessments
The diagnostic performances of the assessments are de-
scribed in Tables 3 and 4. Chest pain history judged by
the physician as typical of AMI increased the probability
of AMI (LR 4.9, Table 3). However, when excluding pa-
tients with ischemic ECG changes and elevated initial
troponins (Table 4), chest pain history deemed typical ofTable 1 Baseline patient characteristics and physician

AMI had only a small impact on the likelihood of AMI
(LR 1.6). Symptoms suspicious of UA also increased the
probability of a final diagnosis of UA (LR 5.6), but in
contrast retained its predictive ability even when there
were no ischemic ECG changes and the initial TnT was
normal (LR 4.7). Meanwhile, symptoms assessed as
not suspicious of ACS almost excluded the diagnosis
(LR 0.02). The presence of any ischemic ECG changes or
an elevated TnT both increased the probability of ACS
markedly (LR 7.6 and 24.9 respectively), while their ab-
sence only had a minimal effect (LR 0.6 and 0.7). The
clinician ’s overall assessments of obvious or strong sus-
picion of ACS significantly raised the probability (LR 29
and 4.8) of ACS, whereas no suspicion of ACS practic-
ally ruled out the diagnosis (LR 0.01).
Discussion
In this prospective study of patients with non-traumatic
chest pain, we analyzed the diagnostic values of the
overall clinical assessment of ACS likelihood, and the
values of the main diagnostic modalities underlying this
assessment, namely the chest pain history, the ECG and
the initial troponin result. Our main findings were three:
First, age < 40 years, chest pain history and overall gestalt
not suspicious of ACS all practically ruled out ACS.
Second, a positive initial TnT and an ischemic ECG were
strong predictors of ACS and seemed superior to pain
history for ruling in ACS. Third, in patients with a nor-
mal initial TnT and non-ischemic ECG, chest pain his-
tory typical of AMI was not a significant predictor of
AMI while chest pain history typical of UA was a mod-
erate predictor of UA.
The present study shows, not surprisingly, that the
overall clinical gestalt was better than its components
both at ruling in ( “Obvious ACS ”, LR 29) and at ruling
out ( “No Suspicion of ACS ”, LR 0.01) ACS. None of the441 patients with a “No Suspicion of ACS ”gestalt had
ACS within 30 days. In accordance with the results
by Kline et al. 2014 (Kline and Stubblefield), a “No
Suspicion ”gestalt thus seems to rule out ACS in the
ED, and to obviate the need for admission, serial tro-
ponins, and stress-testing for the exclusion of ACS.
Miller et al. found that 2.8% of ED patients assessed
as “noncardiac chest pain ”had adverse cardiac events
within 30 days (Miller et al. 2004). However, in that study
TnT was not measured in all patients and the gestalt im-
pression was recorded before biomarkers were drawn.
About half of their patients with adverse cardiac events
turned out to have elevated troponins meaning they
would not have been classified in the “No Suspicion of
ACS ”group in our study. A “No Suspicion of ACS ”gestalt
and a non-suspicious chest pain history both almost ex-
cluded ACS, and one might speculate that the ED physi-
cians based their no suspicion gestalt primarily on the
chest pain history. Our results thus suggest that a non-
suspicious pain history may in many cases be enough to
rule out ACS in the ED, at least if the pretest probability
is low. Only 0.2% of the patients with a non-suspicious
pain history had ACS within 30 days in our population.
Further, the study confirms previous findings that
age < 40 years argues strongly against ACS (Collin et al.
2011; Marsan et al. 2005), while older age has limited pre-
dictive value (Chun and McGee 2004).
We have found four previous publications with data on
the diagnostic or prognostic value of the overall clinical ge-
stalt in patients with possible ACS. However, two of the
studies were from before the modern biomarker era and
focused on AMI only (Karlson et al. 1991; Tierney et al.
1986), one was much smaller than the present study and
included patients without chest pain and/or TnT tests
(Ekelund et al. 2002), and one was primarily prognostic
and included only low risk patients (Chandra et al. 2009).
In the present study, the gestalt had largest predictive
ability when cases were assessed as “Obvious ACS ”or“No
suspicion of ACS ”. In the strong suspicion group, it ap-
peared that the physicians ’gestalt overestimated the likeli-
hood of ACS, since 60% of these patients did not have
ACS. The value of a high grade of suspicion of ACS may
thus be less than generally believed. In this context, Kline
et al. 2014 reported that emergency physicians tend to
overestimate the likelihood of ACS also in low risk patients
(Kline and Stubblefield). In the low suspicion gestalt group
6% of the patients had ACS, which indicates that these pa-
tients should in general undergo further evaluation.
In accordance with previous findings, a negative initial
TnT and a non-ischemic ECG did not reliably rule-out
ACS (Chun and McGee 2004; Ebell et al. 2000; Fesmire
et al. 1989). On the other hand, TnT and ECG seemed
superior to chest pain history for ruling in ACS. Our
findings thus support the practice of admitting all chestTable 4 Diagnostic performances of chest pain history in

pain patients with ischemic ECGs and/or elevated TnT for
additional evaluation. In patients with a non-ischemic
ECG and a negative initial TnT, a pain history typical of
AMI was poorly predictive of AMI (LR 1.6). In contrast,
pain typical of UA was still a moderate predictor of UA
(LR 4.7). The results thus indicate that patients with a pain
history typical of UA should undergo further evaluation,
regardless of the ECG and TnT results, which is probably
true even if highly sensitive troponins are used (Borna
et al. 2014).
Limitations of the study
This study was performed at only one university hospital
and the results are not necessarily generalizable to other
hospitals. However, the prevalence of ACS among chest
pain patients was 12.7%, which is comparable to that in
other studies of unselected ED chest pain patients (Han
et al. 2007; Scheuermeyer et al. 2012).
The discharge diagnoses were those used in routine
clinical care. Since we aimed to study diagnostic value in
routine care, we did not assess the diagnoses for accuracy,
and we have no data on what proportion were based on
objective testing, e.g. stress tests or coronary angiography.
However, at our institution which is the academic cardiac
center for the entire region, most patients are evaluated
with stress testing and virtually all patients with ACS
undergo coronary angiography. All discharge diagnoses
were reviewed for quality and accuracy by the attending
specialist physician (most often cardiologist, in a few cases
internal medicine specialist). In addition, the patients were
followed for 30 days after the ED visit. The discharge diag-
noses reflected real life practice, and we believe that very
few were inaccurate.
In our review of the patient records at 30 days to de-
termine whether an ACS diagnosis was missed or if the
patient died, we may have missed a small number of
patients presenting to other hospitals. However, such
misclassifications were probably few and unlikely to sig-
nificantly affect the results of this study.
In the analysis, patients with or without ongoing chest
pain were not separated. We have no data as to whether
they were evaluated or treated differently.
Suggested definitions of the different levels of ACS
suspicion were present on the study forms, and although
they left considerable room for judgment, other (or no)
definitions may have led to somewhat different results.
The definition of typical symptoms of MI might have
been suboptimal as it is somewhat non-specific, but it is
a definition commonly used in guidelines (Amsterdam
et al. 2010). Although the physicians were instructed to
disregard ECG and TnT when evaluating the symptoms,
we cannot exclude that ECG and TnT results influenced
the symptom assessment in some cases.As TnT was used in the gestalt assessment as well as
in deciding the final diagnosis, incorporation bias could
have been present. This was however probably limited
by the fact that the emergency physicians only had ac-
cess to the initial TnT, whereas the discharge diagnoses
were most often based on repeated TnT analyses to as-
sess for significant rise or fall.
Finally we did not have data regarding physician level
of experience. However, at least in the assessment of
pulmonary embolism, differences in the diagnostic ac-
curacy of the gestalt depending on experience are small
(Kabrhel et al. 2005).
Suggestions for further studies
Many of our results have broad confidence intervals sug-
gesting that a larger study with a similar aim would be
preferable in order to confirm the findings.
Several clinical decision support tools and risk predic-
tion scores for patients with suspected ACS have been
published, e.g. the HEART score (Six et al. 2008). For
any such tool or score to be clinically useful, they have
to be at least as good as the gestalt. We suggest that fu-
ture studies compare new decision support tools and
scores with the physician ’s gestalt assessment. Interest-
ingly, it has been shown that the gestalt performs better
than the Wells score in the assessment of the probability
of pulmonary embolism (Penaloza et al. 2013).
Conclusion
Not surprisingly, gestalt was better than its components
both at ruling in (LR 29) and at ruling out (LR 0.01)
ACS. The gestalt seemed to overestimate the likelihood
of ACS when cases were assessed as strong suspicion of
ACS. Among the components of the gestalt, the initial
TnT and ECG were superior to the chest pain history
for ruling in ACS, while pain history was superior for
ruling out ACS. In patients with a non-ischemic ECG
and a normal TnT, a chest pain history typical of AMI
was not a significant predictor of AMI, but a pain typical
of UA was still a moderately good predictor of UA.
