Abstract 
Background: Exercise electrocardiography (ECG) is a noninvasive test aiming at 
producing ischemic changes. However, resting ECG cannot be adopted in diagnosing 
myocardial ischemia till ST ‑segment depressions. Therefore, this study aimed to detect 
myocardial energy defects in resting ECG using the Hilbert–Huang transformation 
(HHT) in patients with angina pectoris.
Methods: Electrocardiographic recordings of positive exercise ECG by performing cor ‑
onary imaging test (n = 26) and negative exercise ECG (n = 47) were collected. Based 
on the coronary stenoses severity, patients were divided into three categories: normal, 
< 50%, and ≥ 50%. During the resting phase of the exercise ECG, all 10‑s ECG signals are 
decomposed by HHT. The RT intensity index, composed of the power spectral density 
of the P , QRS, and T components, is used to estimate the myocardial energy defect.
Results: After analyzing the resting ECG using HHT, the RT intensity index was 
significantly higher in patients with positive exercise ECG (27.96%) than in those with 
negative exercise ECG (22.30%) (p < 0.001). In patients with positive exercise ECG, the 
RT intensity index was gradually increasing with the severity of coronary stenoses: 
25.25% (normal, n = 4), 27.14% (stenoses < 50%, n = 14), and 30.75% (stenoses ≥ 50%, 
n = 8). The RT intensity index of different coronary stenoses was significantly higher in 
patients with negative exercise ECG, except for the normal coronary imaging test.
Conclusions: Patients with coronary stenoses had a higher RT index at the resting 
stage of exercise ECG. Resting ECG analyzed using HHT could be a method for the early 
detection of myocardial ischemia.

Background
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), including coronary artery disease (CAD), are the lead -
ing cause of death globally with an unmet need on decreasing mortality [1, 2]. CAD is 
pathologically characterized by atherosclerotic plaque accumulation in the epicardial 
arteries, whether obstructive or non-obstructive. Electrocardiography (ECG) measures 
the myocardial electrical activity widely used to detect CAD [3–6]. CAD or myocardial *Correspondence:

ischemia is usually diagnosed based on the detection of repolarization abnormalities of 
ECG signals, mainly during ST-segment depressions [7]. Pathological Q waves or left 
bundle branch block could be another indirect sign of CAD during resting ECG. If a 
patient has a high clinical likelihood of CAD without significant ischemia changes during 
resting ECG, an exercise ECG test is suitable for measuring the initial, middle, and post-
ECG exercise while strengthening the heart’s oxygen consumption [7]. As the patient’s 
body works harder during the exercise ECG test, limitation of the coronary blood flow 
due to obstructive CAD may result in ischemia changes during ECG. However, exer -
cise ECG has limited the power to confirm obstructive CAD [7]. Muscle contraction, 
baseline wander, and powerline interference will interfere with ECG signals during ECG 
analysis [8]. If CAD cannot be excluded by clinical assessment, using noninvasive coro -
nary computed tomography is recommended to establish the diagnosis [7, 9].
Additional analysis of ECG signals could be another method to improve the accuracy 
of the ECG exercise test. Various methods have been used to extract ECG features to 
diagnose a clinical disease, including Hilbert–Huang transformation (HHT) [10], which 
applies nonlinear and nonstationary signals and is a relatively new method used in bio -
medical data analysis [10]. Statistical characteristics are extracted from instinct mode 
functions obtained by applying HHT to R–R intervals. HHT decomposes the original 
ECG signals through the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) for myocardial energy 
analysis [11], and has been extensively used in disease detection, including heart failure, 
atrial fibrillation and CAD [10]. The addition of HHT in patients with suspected CAD 
could enhance the accuracy; however, the difference in myocardial ischemia in different 
stages of the ECG exercise test was less discussed [7, 10, 11]. This study aimed to detect 
the level of myocardial energy defect in resting ECG and analyze the noninvasive HHT 
test to predict CAD.
Results
After excluding the positive exercise ECG without coronary imaging test, a total of 
73 patients who underwent exercise ECG were enrolled in the study, consisting of 47 
patients (male: 34 and female: 13) with negative ECG as a reference group. Based on 
the coronary stenoses severity, patients with positive ECG exercise (n = 26; male: 16 and 
female: 10) were divided into three groups: normal (n = 4), < 50% (n = 14), and ≥ 50% 
(n = 8) stenoses (Fig. 1).
Compared with the reference group of negative exercise ECG, the following analysis 
models were designed: model 1, positive exercise ECG (n = 26); model 2, stenoses < 50% 
(n = 18) and ≥ 50% (n = 8) stenoses; and model 3, normal (n = 4), < 50% (n = 14), and 
≥ 50% (n = 8) stenoses. All resting-stage recordings of exercise ECG were analyzed using 
HHT, and the myocardial energy defect was estimated using the RT intensity index 
(Table 1, Additional files 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12 and 13).
Model 1: Comparing the energy difference of resting exercise ECG energy between 
the positive and negative exercise groups, the RT intensity index of the positive exer -
cise ECG group (27.96% ± 6.14%) was significantly higher than that of the negative group 
(22.30% ± 4.34%) (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2, Table 2 and Additional file 1).
Model 2: Based on the coronary stenoses severity, patients with positive exercise 
ECG (n = 26) were divided into two groups: < 50% (N = 18) and ≥ 50% (N = 8) coronary

stenoses (Fig.  3-A). The RT index of the group with < 50% (26.72% ± 5.27%) or ≥ 50% 
(30.75% ± 7.36%) coronary stenoses was significantly higher than that in the negative 
group (22.30% ± 4.34%) (p = 0.008 and p < 0.001) (Table 3, Additional file 2).

(n = 26) were divided into three groups: normal (n = 4), < 50% (n = 14), and ≥ 50%

between the negative exercise ECG (22.30% ± 4.34%) and normal coronary image groups 
(25.25% ± 5.91%; p = 0.73). The RT index of coronary stenoses of < 50% (27.14% ± 5.23%) 
or ≥ 50% (30.75% ± 7.36%) was significantly higher (p = 0.022 and p < 0.001) (Table  3). 
The diagnostic accuracy of the RT index during the resting phase of the exercise ECG for 
differentiating between myocardial ischemia and different coronary stenoses, as quan -
tified by the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) was 0.789

Discussion
The main findings of the present study indicated that patients with significant coronary 
stenoses had a higher RT index in the resting stage of exercise ECG. Moreover, resting 
ECG signals analyzed by HHT could be a method of the early detection of myocardial 
energy defects in patients with angina pectoris.
According to the 2019 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the diagnosis 
and management of chronic coronary syndromes, a resting ECG is useful for the early 
detection of CAD [7, 12]. A resting ECG is an important tool for diagnosing myocardial 
ischemia, whereas dynamic ST-segment changes are recorded during ongoing angina or 
myocardial infarction. Although even ambulatory ECG monitoring is capable of detect -
ing silent ischemia in chronic coronary syndrome patients, resting ECG cannot replace 
exercise ECG as it can rarely provide any information that could help in the diagnosis or 
prognosis of myocardial ischemia [7]. Therefore, an exercise ECG with increased myo -
cardial oxygen consumption may be considered in patients with a clinical likelihood of 
CAD. However, exercise ECG has very limited diagnostic power in detecting obstructive 
CAD, compared with coronary imaging tests [7, 13]. Besides, a resting or exercise ECG 
with pre-existing repolarization abnormalities, such as pathological Q waves or conduc -
tion abnormalities, will influence the accuracy of detecting CAD. In an extensive study

of 3094 patients for > 12 years (1969–1981), five elements (maximum exercise rhythm, 
number of exercises, CAD, angina pectoris type, age, and gender) had significant inde -
pendent effects on exercise ECG testing sensitivity [14]. Exercise ECG combined with 
the functional image test could confirm the CAD diagnosis; however, the process is 
more time-consuming or costly [7].
The ECG reflects changes in the myocardial bioelectricity in the  R3 space in each 
cardiac cycle and presents the results in the  R2 space ECG. Muscle contraction, base -
line wander, and powerline interference will interfere with ECG signals during analy -
sis [8 ]. Various methods have been used to extract ECG feature disorders to diagnose a 
clinical disease, including wavelet analysis, discrete Fourier transform, EMD, second-
order difference plot, wavelet packet decomposition, or HHT [2 , 10, 12, 15–25]. The 
EMD has a large frequency distribution and high sample rate, especially in long time 
series [26], and is computationally expensive with some serious disadvantages such 
as border effects and mode mixing [27– 30]. WT/FFT employs an integral method 
on a pre-established basis via the inner product method to determine the content of 
the base component in the data as a representative of the spectrum intensity, and the 
change of the disturbance frequency or wavelength may have occurred prior to the 
entire period of disturbance. The occurrence (the so-called intra-wave). HHT uses a 
differential method to decompose the signal into several IMFs with good symmetry 
properties. The perturbation frequency and amplitude of each IMF can change with 
time, and the manner of change is completely determined by the characteristics of the 
data itself. This basis is not pre-settled. Which is fixed and obtained by decompos -
ing the signal itself through EMD, which belongs to the post-basis. The instantane -
ous frequency obtained by HHT has a clear physical meaning and can characterize 
the signal’s local characteristics [31]. Despite the limited theoretical analysis, nonlin -
ear and nonstationary signal problems can be solved with HHT [4 , 5, 32, 33]. HHT

with EMD and Hilbert spectral analysis has been extensively used to analyze non -
stationary signals, including heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and CAD [10]. Feature 
extraction of ECG signals using the HHT algorithm was independent of the 12-lead 
ECG detection method and had been widely used for detecting the myocardial energy 
defect [34, 35]. Patients with CAD could be distinguished from normal patients using 
features obtained by applying wavelet transformation and power spectral destiny for 
R–R intervals [10]. When comparing C1, C2, and C3 decomposed from pulse wave, 
no significant difference was observed in component C1 between healthy adults and 
patients with CAD but showed significant differences in component C3 (p < 0.05) [6 ]. 
Using the HHT algorithm in exercise ECG could improve the accuracy of diagnosis of 
myocardial ischemia [11]
In our previous study, we used two methods:
Method 1:  Different stages exercise ECG before/during/post.
Method 2:  Only use resting ECG before exercise.
The study reported that applying the HHT algorithm with the RT intensity and ST 
kinetic energy indices could reduce the pseudo-positive rate by 83.3%, as compared 
with exercise ECG only [11]. The ST kinetic energy index contained C4 and C5 com -
ponents and is more sensitive to the QRS energy changes. Therefore, the ST kinetic 
energy index reflected a significant energy defect during the exercise stage of ECG 
[11]. However, a significant difference in the RT intensity index in the resting stage of 
exercise ECG was observed between patients with negative and positive exercise ECG 
[11]. In our study, we also found the myocardial energy defect in the resting stage of 
exercise ECG via the RT intensity index. In patients with positive exercise ECG, the 
RT intensity index was gradually increasing with the coronary stenoses severity. No 
significant difference in the RT intensity index was observed between positive exer -
cise ECG with normal coronary imaging test and negative exercise ECG.
To the best of our knowledge, this was the first study to evaluate the relationship 
between coronary stenoses and myocardial energy difference of HHT in the resting 
stage of exercise ECG. Several study limitations should be considered in this study, 
i.e., the absence of prospective power and the small sample sizes. Therefore, we could 
not assess the benefits of detecting the early energy defect in the high-risk group 
based on future events. Further studies may investigate the accuracy, sensitivity, and 
specificity of the RT intensity index in predicting CAD during a resting ECG, as well 
as the effect of the differences between different ages and genders.
Conclusions
The resting stage of exercise ECG signal combined with HHT analysis can predict 
myocardial ischemia before the exercise stage. Patients with severe coronary stenoses 
had a higher RT index during the resting stage of exercise ECG than those with nega -
tive exercise ECG and normal or insignificant coronary stenoses. The resting ECG 
analyzed by HHT could be used as a new method for the early detection of myocar -
dial ischemia before exercise ECG tests or invasive imaging studies.

Methods
Study population
In this retrospective study, all patients with angina pectoris and who underwent exercise 
ECG tests were screened between August 2017 and September 2018. The Institutional 
Review Board of Mackay Memorial Hospital approved this study protocol (IRB No. 
17MMHIS004e), which waived the requirement for informed consent in this retrospec -
tive study. The treating physicians decided on the need to perform exercise ECG tests 
after excluding ECG abnormalities, including LBBB, paced rhythm, Wolff–Parkinson–
White syndrome, ≥ 0.1-mV ST-segment depression on resting ECG, or who are being 
treated with digitalis. The use of exercise ECG test was indicated by treating physicians 
and re-confirmed by other two cardiologists. Patients with positive exercise ECG were 
suggested to undergo coronary imaging, including coronary angiography or computed 
tomography. Based on the coronary stenoses severity, patients with positive exercise 
ECG were divided into three groups: normal, < 50%, and ≥ 50% stenoses. According to 
2019 ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of chronic coronary syndromes 
[7], the negative predictive value of exercise ECG was higher than positive predictive 
value. The likelihood of CAD was less than 15% if negative exercise ECG. Therefore, 
patients with negative exercise ECG were defined as a relative health group. Compared 
with patients with negative exercise ECG, analysis models were designed (model 1, posi -
tive exercise ECG; model 2, < 50% and ≥ 50% stenoses; and model 3, normal, < 50%, and 
≥ 50% stenoses).
Resting ECG signal data
After removing the baseline drift and the EMG signals in the first 7 s, stable resting ECG 
signals of 10 s were analyzed by pre-processing, feature extraction then classified by dif -
ferent coronary stenoses severities (Fig. 5).
The main ECG energy is concentrated at 0–40 Hz. The ECG signal can be divided 
into three components: P , QRS, and T based on waveform characteristics. In this 
Fig. 5 Structure of proposed diagnostic blocks
Page 10 of 14 Wang et al. BioMedical Engineering OnLine           (2023) 22:23 
study, the total ECG energy was decomposed into C1–8 spectrum components 
through EMD (Fig. 6 ):
• C1 and C2 are the highest frequency decomposition components of the QRS wave.
• C3 adds the P wave’s decomposition components.
• C4 adds the decomposition component of the T wave, resulting from the superposi -
tion of three components: P , QRS, and T wave.
• C5 is a superposition of low-frequency components of P , QRS, and T waves.
• C6 represents the cardiac cycle, showing the heartbeat rhythm.
• C7 and C8 are cardiac physiological adjustment rhythms on a long-term scale, repre -
senting the heart’s long-term rhythm.
C1, C2, … to Cn represent disturbances from small to large wavelength scales. 
We can imagine the superposition of these disturbances as a small wave riding on 
an enormous wave, with still smaller waves on top of each of these small waves. The 
wavelength, frequency, and amplitude of each wave will change with time. Unlike the 
base assumed by FFT, the frequency and amplitude are unchanged and constant.
The RT intensity index was defined as:
α∣C1∣ + β∣C2∣ + γ∣C3∣)/∣C total∣α/β/γ are weighting parameters of empirical correlation 
following rules
(1) (α + β + γ) is less than 1.
(2) α ≥ β ≥ γ.RT=αC1+βC2+γC3

the R wave intensity ratio (C1, C2, and C3 components compared to the total of C1–8) 
[11]. The RT index can display myocardial energy changes during resting ECG and is 
more sensitive in the QRS complex. All resting-stage electrocardiographic recordings of 
exercise ECG were analyzed using the RT intensity index (Fig. 7).
Statistical analysis
A two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures followed by a Bonferroni post-hoc 
test was used to analyze the RT index of resting-stage exercise ECG. The RT intensity 
index of negative exercise ECG was defined as a negative threshold. RT intensity indi -
ces of patients with positive exercise ECG were divided into three models based on the 
coronary stenoses severity. Compared with the negative threshold of the RT index, these 
models were used to analyze the positive exercise ECG group. Statistical significance 
was set at p < 0.05. All data analyses were performed using IBM SPSS statistics 20 for 
windows (IBM Corp., Chicago, IL, USA).
