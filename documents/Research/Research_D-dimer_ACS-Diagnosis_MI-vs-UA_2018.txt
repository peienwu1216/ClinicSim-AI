Diagnostic Value of D-Dimer in Acute Myocardial Infarction 
Among Patients With Suspected Acute Coronary Syndrome

Abstract
Background:  The role of D-dimer as a diagnostic marker in myo-
cardial infarction (MI) and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is still 
a question. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic 
value of D-dimer in the diagnosis of AMI in patients suspected with ACS.
Methods:  This cross-sectional study was conducted on patients 
suspected with ACS. Serial standard 12-lead electrocardiogram 
(ECG), D-dimer, and troponin tests were done for all the patients. 
According to the examinations, ECG changes, and troponin, pa-
tients were allocated into two groups of MI and unstable angina (UA). Chi-square, independent t -test, and Pearson correlation test 
were used by SPSS ver, 17. Cut-off point of D-dimer for MI di-agnosis was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
Results:  Seventy-five patients with a mean age of 63.1 ± 9.75 
years were studied in two groups of MI (n = 34) and UA (n = 
41). Patients were homogeneous based on age, gender, and risk 
factors for diabetes and dyslipidemia. D-dimer in patients with MI patients was higher than in patients with UA (P = 0.001). The optimal cut-off point of D-dimer for diagnosis of MI was 
548 mEq/L with sensitivity and specifity of 63.4% and 91.2%, 
respectively.
Conclusions: Based on the results of this study, it seems that the 
measurement of D-dimer serum level can be appropriate as a marker with high sensitivity and relatively high specificity for differentiating MI from UA in patients with suspected ACS.

Introduction
Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a common cause of pres-
entation in emergency departments (EDs) [1]. Early detection 
and rapid ruleout of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have 
always been one of the great concerns to reduce mortality, morbidity, and hospitalization costs and avoid doing further 
diagnostic and unnecessary interventions in low risk patients 
[1, 2]. Routinely, the serial electrocardiograms (ECGs), bio-
markers, and clinical decision rules have been used for the 
risk stratifications and diagnosis of ACS [3]. Cardiac enzymes start to rise within hours after onset of symptoms. On the other 
hand, ECG has not shown to have a reliable sensitivity in early 
diagnosis of MI [1, 4]. Thus, attempts continue to find a better 
way to triage and a more rapid diagnosis of ACS. Coronary 
artery thrombosis is the cause of acute ischemic syndromes. Several markers involved in the formation and lysis of arte -
rial thrombosis have been identified among which Fibrinogen, plasmin-α
2 antiplasmin, prothrombin, activated factor VII and 
D-dimer can be noted. It is anticipated that the levels of these enzymes change with the incidence of coronary artery throm-bosis [1, 3, 5]. The D-dimer was used as a diagnostic marker 
in venous thromboembolism [6], but few studies recently dem-
onstrated the diagnostic value of D-dimer in the diagnosis of 
MI and ACS [3, 5, 7-10]. This study aimed to evaluate the di-
agnostic value of D-dimer in the diagnosis of AMI in patients 
suspected with ACS in an academic ED.
Methods
Research design and setting
This cross-sectional study was conducted from April 2015 to 
February 2016 in the ED of Imam Reza Hospital, and urban academic ED located in Mashhad, Iran. Inclusion criteria were 
patients with typical chest pain, which defines as a substernal 
pain, provoked by exertion, or relieved by rest or nitroglycer -
in-suspected ACS presented to ED with age greater than 18 years old, onset of symptoms less than 24 h. Exclusion criteria were positive family history of cardiovascular disease, use of Manuscript submitted October 9, 2017, accepted October 19, 2017

steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, cytotoxic 
drugs, beta blockers, nitrate and aspirin, anticoagulants such as warfarin and heparin.
SamplingSample size and method
Patients were studied in purposive random sampling in the two 
groups with and without MI. The sample size of this study was estimated based on alpha of 0.05 and beta of 20% and using comparison of two mean sample size formula. Accordingly, at 
least 28 patients were studied in each of the two groups.
Data collection
The patients with typical chest pain for ACS and related his-
tory and physical examination were enrolled in the study. Their data about age, sex, duration of pain, location of pain, onset of pain, quality of pain, radiation of pain, associated symptoms, and ACS risk factors such as diabetes and dyslipidemia were collected. All patients were subjected to ECG and blood sam-pling in order to measure serum level of D-dimer and troponin on ED presentation. Then with ECG’s findings and troponin serum levels, they were categorized to STEMI, non-STEMI, 
or UA.
Measurement tool
D-dimer
Serum sample was taken to determine D-dimer level at the 
time of presentation to ED and before receiving heparin. Se-rum D-dimer level was measured by enzyme-linked immuno -
sorbent assay (ELISA).
Diagnosis of MI
Patients with the diagnosis of AMI were classified into two 
groups of STEMI and non-STEMI according to ECG changes. Other patients under study were placed in the UA group if not diagnosed with MI.
Ethical consideration
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Mashhad 
University of Medical Sciences (code: 930281) and all patients were informed about the plan and signed written consent form was available.
Statistical analysis
Demographic and paraclinical data obtained from patients 
were statistically analyzed using SPSS 17.0 for Windows (SSPS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Data were expressed as mean ± SD and P < 0.05 was considered significant. How to distrib-ute data was initially examined. Then the homogeneity of the groups under comparison (MI and UA) was studied in terms of age, sex and risk factors for diabetes and dyslipidemia. Then to compare quantitative data (D-dimer serum level and troponin) between MI and UA groups, independent t -test and 
to compare the data among the three groups of STEMI, NSTE-MI, and UA, ANOV A test were used. In case of non-normal distribution of data, non-parametric equivalents of tests were used. In order to determine cut-off point to diagnose MI based on the level of D-dimer, the rock curve was used and to calcu-late the sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative pre-dictive value of D-dimer in the diagnosis of MI, MedCalc 15 software was used.
Results
Baseline characteristics
Over the 10-month course of study, 97 patients were enrolled 
and 22 patients were excluded. Exclusion causes included a positive family history of cardiovascular disease (14 patients), using heart medications like beta blockers, nitrate and aspirin (four patients), occurrence of arrhythmias (two patients), and using anticoagulants (two patients). Finally, 75 patients with a mean age of 63.1 ± 9.75 years were studied. The two groups Table 1.

of patients with MI (n = 34) and UA (n = 41) were not signifi-
cantly different in age, gender, and risk factors for diabetes and dyslipidemia (Table 1).
Troponin and D-dimer level
Average troponin in all patients was 0.42 ± 0.4 mEq/L. MI 
group has a higher level of serum troponin in admission com-pared to UA group (P = 0.001) (Table 1). Besides, the mean serum level of D-dimer was 1,087.61 ± 395.63 mEq/L in all patients and was higher in patients with MI than in patients with UA (P = 0.001) (Table 1).
Subgroup analysis
Moreover, the results of this study showed that the three 
groups of STEMI, NSTEMI and UA are significantly different in terms of troponin levels (P = 0.001) and D-dimer levels (P = 0.001), based on ANOV A (Table 2). But according to the post hoc test, this dispute arises from the difference in the serum levels between the group of patients with UA and NSTEMI and the group with UA and STEMI (Table 2).
D-dimer and correlated factors
Based on the analysis of Pearson correlation, a moderate to 
weak correlation was observed between D-dimer and age (P = 0.005, r = 0.32), blood glucose (P = 0.006, r = 0.31) and tro-ponin (P = 0.000, r = 0.57).
Diagnostic value of D-dimer
To find the cut-off point with the highest sensitivity and spec-
ificity of D-dimer serum level in the diagnosis of MI, ROC curve was used. Based on the results of ROC curve, the best cut-off point for MI is 548 mEq/L in terms of D-dimer (Fig. 1). The sensitivity and specificity of this point in differentiat -
ing MI from UA in patients presenting with ACS is 63.4% and Table 2.  Comparing Serum Level of D-Dimer and Troponin in Three Groups of Patients With Myocardial Infarction With ST Segment

91.2%, respectively (Table 3).
Discussion
In the past, D-dimer was simply used as a marker in venous 
thromboembolism as well as aortic dissection and few studies have been conducted on its role in the diagnosis of MI [1-5]. 
Our study was aimed to determine the diagnostic value of a 
D-dimer test for MI in patients with suspected ACS and the results showed that D-dimer can also be used as a diagnostic 
marker with appropriate sensitivity and specificity in the diag-
nosis of MI.
Today, the measurement of troponin is considered as one 
of the most selective markers in the diagnosis of myocardial 
damage [5, 8]. Although, the fundamental flaw against them 
is an increase in their serum level 3 - 4 h after the onset of symptoms. Thus, in most centers, these markers should be re-viewed in consecutive times. And in this case, their application 
in rapid triage of patients with MI is faced with ambiguity [2]. 
Also, it is still believed that more biomarkers should be found for the faster diagnosis of coronary thrombosis as a hallmark 
of ACS [1]. D-dimer is produced by destruction and the break-
down of fibrin clot at the site of injury by plasmin, which rep-resents the manufacture of active thrombosis and its lysis [11, 12]. D-dimer level is expected to increase in acute ischemic 
events faster than in other cardiac markers because D-dimer 
is created faster than other markers in the course of the ACS pathophysiology [9, 12].
On the other hand, studies have shown that D-dimer is in 
direct relationship with the occurrence or recurrence of cardio -
vascular diseases, so that patients whose D-dimer is in upper one-third of D-dimer levels, are 70% more at risk of CHD than those in lower one-third of D-dimer levels [3]. Baya-Genis et 
al have shown that plasma level of D-dimer in patients with 
MI and UA is more than in patients without ischemic event. Also, plasma D-dimer in patients with MI was higher than in patients with UA [3]. Besides, this study also demonstrated 
that D-dimer greater than 500 ng/mL along with ECG findings 
and patients’ histories, can improve diagnosis of MI (sensitiv-
ity increases from 73% to 92%) [3]. In our study, the best cut-
off point was achieved in differentiating MI from UA in 548, so that it had sensitivity of 91.2% and specificity of 63.4%. Moreover, by raising the cut-off point to 682 ng/mL in our 
study, the results indicate an increase in specificity of D-di-
mer test up to 70.7% and by lowering the cut-off point to 474 ng/mL, the results indicate an increase in D-dimer sensitivity 
up to 100%. Considering the present results of this study and Bayes-Genis’ study, it seems that the serum level higher than 
500 - 550 ng/mL can be assumed as a reliable cut-off point in 
differentiating MI from UA in reality as well [3]. The main 
objective of our study is differentiating MI from non-MI in patients with ACS. However, most studies have evaluated the 
diagnostic value of D-dimer in forecasting ACS from pains 
with non-cardiac origin. In Orak et al’s study, D-dimer serum level in the case group with ACS was obtained about 2.31 ± 
2.34 and the D-dimer sensitivity and specificity in the dif-
ferentiating ACS from non-ACS was specified as 95.4% and 
83.7%, respectively [13]. However, in all studies, high positive 
predictive value of D-dimer has not been reported. And it is expressed in Lippi et al’s study that D-dimer cannot be used as 
an independent diagnostic factor in MI due to specificity and low negative predictive value (41% and 27%, respectively) 
and it must be used alongside another diagnostic marker [10]. Moreover, the use of multiple biomarkers including D-dimer 
has been recommended in Tello-Montoliu’s study in diagnosis 
of ACS [4]. But what seems to be the main cause of the dif-ference between the results such as the found cut-off point and 
the diagnostic power of that point for diagnosis of MI or ACS, 
is the duration of onset of symptoms up to measuring D-dimer 
level apart from racial differences, sample size, the instrument 
used to measure D-dimer and the applied method and this is 
the subject which has not been referred to in various studies in-
cluding ours and is one of the limitations of our study. Besides, other limitations of this study are the lack of a control group 
of normal subjects. If a group of normal subjects were enrolled 
in this study, we could evaluate the diagnostic power of D-
dimer in differentiating ACS from non-ACS events. Moreover, 
a recent study has not examined the prognostic value of D-dimer in patients with ACS, while some studies conducted in 
recent decade have examined the prognostic value of D-dimer 
in predicting mortality following ACS [7, 14-16]. Therefore, it 
is recommended that future studies to be carried out as clinical 
trials for comparing different methods of measuring D-dimer and its impact on its diagnostic power in differentiating ACS 
from non-ACS and MI from UA.
Conclusion
Based on the results of this study, it seems that the measurement 
of D-dimer serum level can be appropriate as a marker with 
high sensitivity and relatively high specificity for differentiat -
ing MI from UA in patients with suspected ACS. Especially, 
given the high sensitivity of this marker, and its availability in 
most EDs, it seems that D-dimer can be used for the appropri-
ate triage of patients, and referring them to cardiologists fast for more specialized treatments. However, it is suggested other 
cardiac biomarkers to be used in combination with D-dimer measurement based on the findings of other results in order to 
improve diagnostic power of D-dimer.
