Abstract
Introduction: The present study aims to evaluate the utility of D-dimer test-ing for differentiating the causes of acute chest pain, including acute aor -
tic dissection (AAD), pulmonary embolism (PE), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), unstable angina (UA), and other uncertain diagnoses of chest pain.Material and methods: Consecutive patients admitted for acute chest pain 
within 24 h from symptom onset were enrolled prospectively, and plasma D-dimer levels were measured on admission. Diagnoses of AAD, PE, AMI, and UA were confirmed by standard methods.Results: A total of 790 patients were enrolled, including 202 AAD, 43 PE, 315 AMI, 136 UA, and 94 cases of other uncertain diagnoses. D-dimer levels were significantly higher in patients with AAD and PE than in those with AMI, UA, and other uncertain diagnoses (p < 0.001), but they were com-
parable between patients with AAD and PE (p = 0.065). Moreover, patients 
with type A  AAD had higher D-dimer levels than those with type B AAD  
(p = 0.022). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed 
that a D-dimer level < 0.5 µg/ml was a good predictor for ruling out AAD, with a sensitivity of 94.0% and a specificity of 56.8%. At a cut-off level of 0.5 µg/ml, the negative and positive likelihood ratios were 0.10 and 2.18, respectively, with a positive predictive value of 42.6% and a negative predic-tive value of 96.6%.Conclusions: The D-dimer level within 24 h after symptom onset might be 
helpful for differentiating AAD from other causes of chest pain.
Key words: pulmonary embolism, acute myocardial infarction, unstable 
angina, chest pain.
Introduction
Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a relatively uncommon medical emer -
gency with a high mortality after symptom onset. The mortality of acute 
type A  aortic dissection increases by 1–2% per hour during the first  
48 h if no treatment is received [1]. Meanwhile, other common causes 
of acute chest pain, such as acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and pul-
monary embolism (PE), also require rapid differentiation from AAD due 
to their critical and lethal characteristics [2]. However, the misdiagnosis 
rate of AAD has been reported to be approximately 30% on initial evalu-
Wenlong Li, Bi Huang, Li Tian, Yanmin Yang, Weili Zhang, Xiaojian Wang, Jingzhou Chen, Kai Sun, Rutai Hui, Xiaohan Fan592 Arch Med Sci 3, April / 2017ation [3, 4]. Currently, noninvasive imaging modal-
ities, including enhanced computed tomography 
(CT), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have been developed to improve the diagnosis of AAD, but 
these imaging modalities are expensive, time-con-
suming and unavailable at the bedside. Therefore, a  rapid, cheap, reliable and sensitive laboratory 
test is urgently needed to diagnose AAD. 
D-dimer, the degradation product of cross 
linked fibrin, is significantly elevated in AAD pa-tients [5–8] and has been suggested for use as 
a  complementary marker to rule out AAD [5–7, 9–11]. However, in real-world clinical practice, 
AAD, PE and AMI are all thrombogenic diseases 
with high mortality, and whether the D-dimer level is helpful for differentiating these diseases 
remains to be elucidated. We therefore conducted 
a prospective cohort study to evaluate the validity and reliability of D-dimer level for differentiating AAD from other types of acute chest pain, includ-
ing PE, AMI, unstable angina (UA), and other un-
certain diagnoses of chest pain.
Material and methods
Study population
A  single-center, prospective cohort study was 
conducted in Fuwai Hospital (the National Center 
for Cardiovascular Diseases in China) from Janu-
ary 2009 to January 2010. A series of consecutive patients with acute chest pain who presented to 
the emergency department (ED) of Fuwai Hospi-
tal within 24 h of symptom onset were enrolled in a prospective manner. Baseline clinical charac-
teristics such as sex, age, Stanford types of AAD, 
intervals from onset of symptoms to hospital ad-mission, medical histories, baseline parameters 
of physical examinations and laboratory tests 
including C-reactive protein (CRP), imaging exam-inations, in-hospital managements, ED diagnosis 
and discharge diagnosis were recorded according 
to pre-designed case report forms. The study pro-tocols were approved by the appropriate institu-tional review boards of Fuwai Hospital and com-
plied with the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects 
provided written informed consent. 
D-dimer test and diagnosis
Plasma D-dimer levels were measured using 
a stago-evolution device (France) in patients with 
chest pain immediately following admission. The 
results collected are expressed in micrograms per milliliter. The effective detection range of the as-
say is 0.22–20 µg/ml. Diagnoses of AAD and PE 
were confirmed by aorta or pulmonary angiogra-phy with multi-detector CT scan. Acute myocardial 
infarction was confirmed by acute chest pain, ele-vated cardiac-enzyme levels (cardiac troponin I or 
T, or the MB fraction of creatine kinase exceeded the 99
th percentile upper reference limit), docu-
mented findings of a new ST segment elevation/depression or a new T wave inversion on electro-cardiography, and/or with evidence of obstructive coronary artery on angiography. Unstable angina was confirmed by chest pain, ST segment depres-sion or T wave changes with evidence of obstruc-tive coronary artery on angiography, but without the elevation of cardiac enzymes. 
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are presented as mean ± 
SD or median and interquartile range according to whether they follow Gaussian distributions. Cat-egorical data are presented as numbers and pro-portions. Baseline characteristics between groups were compared using Student’s t  test or the non-
parametric Mann-Whitney test for continuous data and the c
2 test for categorical data. Receiver-oper -
ating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to calculate the sensitivity for AAD. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. A p-value < 0.05 
was considered statistically significant. The statis-tical calculations were performed with SPSS 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA).
Results
A  total of 790 patients were enrolled, includ-
ing 202 AAD, 43 PE, 315 AMI, 136 UA, and 94 cases with other uncertain diagnoses. Of the 202 AAD patients confirmed by CT angiography, 119 (58.9%) were Stanford type A AAD cases and 83 (41.0%) were Stanford type B AAD cases. 
Patient demographics and baseline character -
istics are shown in Table I. Compared to the pa-tients with other causes of chest pain, AAD pa-tients were more likely to be younger and male and tended to have concomitant hypertension but rarely have diabetes mellitus (all p < 0.001).
The D-dimer level was elevated (> 0.50 µg/ml) 
in 190 (94.1%) AAD patients. The D-dimer level 
in AAD patients was approximately 9-fold higher 
than that in non-AAD patients (median: 4.19 vs. 0.45 µg/ml, p < 0.05). Figure 1 shows the D-di-
mer level in patients with different causes of chest pain. The D-dimer level was significantly higher in patients with AAD than in patients with UA (me-dian: 0.38 µg/ml, p < 0.001), AMI (median: 0.45 
µg/ml, p < 0.001) and other uncertain diagnoses 
(median: 0.44 µg/ml, p < 0.001), but it was com-
parable with that of PE patients (median: 2.72 µg/ml, p = 0.065). Similarly, the D-dimer level in PE 
patients was significantly higher than that in pa-tients with UA, AMI, or other uncertain diagnoses (all p < 0.001). Moreover, patients with type A AAD

Arch Med Sci 3, April / 2017 593had higher D-dimer levels than those with type B 
AAD (median: 4.64 vs. 4.0 µg/ml, p = 0.022).
Figure 2 shows the ROC for patients with AAD 
versus non-AAD patients. The AUC value was 0.90 (95% CI: 0.87–0.93) for patients with AAD 
vs. all non-AAD patients. The AUC value was 0.59  
(95% CI: 0.5–0.68) vs. PE, 0.91 (95% CI: 0.88–0.94) 
vs. AMI, 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93–0.97) vs. UA, and 0.93 
(95% CI: 0.91–0.96) vs. patients with other uncer -
tain diagnoses. Moreover, the best cut-off value of D-dimer for predicting PE was 1.14 µg/ml by ROC 
analysis with an AUC of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.74–0.84). The sensitivity and specificity were 88.4% and 71.2%, respectively.
The diagnostic performance at the cutoff lev-
el of 0.5 µg/ml was analyzed. At this cutoff level, the sensitivity was 94.0% and the specificity was 
56.8% for AAD compared to non-AAD patients; 
the negative and positive likelihood ratio were 0.10 and 2.18, respectively with a positive predic-
tive value of 42.6% and a negative predictive val-
ue of 96.6%. The specificity was 4% for PE, 56% 
for AMI, 72.9% for UA, and 65.1% for uncertain 
diagnostic cases (Table II). Table I. Baseline characteristics of AAD patients and non-AAD (PE, UA, AMI, and uncertain diagnosis)

The present study demonstrated a significantly 
higher admission D-dimer level in patients with 
AAD within 24 h after symptom onset than those 
with AMI, UA, and other uncertain diagnoses. At the widely used cutoff level of 0.5 µg/ml, a favor -
able negative likelihood ratio of 0.10 and negative predictive value of 96.6% were found in patients with AAD. However, the D-dimer level was not significantly different between patients with AAD 
and PE. Our study suggests that a plasma D-dimer 
test within 24 h of symptom onset may be helpful for differentiating AAD and PE from other causes of acute chest pain.
Acute aortic dissection is a catastrophic medi-
cal emergency, which requires early and accurate diagnosis and treatment. Imaging modalities, in-cluding enhanced CT and MRI, can facilitate an 
accurate diagnosis. However, these methods are 
limited due to unavailability at the bedside and their time-consuming nature, and they are not 
cost effective for routine screening. Thus, a rapid 
and reliable biomarker is urgently needed. Previ-ous studies have evaluated several biomarkers for AAD, such as the smooth muscle myosin heavy 
chain [12–14], the BB-isozyme of creatine kinase 
[15], and calponin [16]. However, none of these markers have been adopted into routine clinical practice due to their inability to meet the require-
ments of a  ‘gold standard’ biomarker including 
having adequate sensitivity and specificity in ad-dition to a favorable time course of release that covers a time window necessary for nonambiguity 
in the clinical setting [17]. D-dimer is a fibrin frag-
ment seen in coagulopathic disorders, and mea-surements are routinely used for the exclusion of 
venous thromboembolic diseases and PE [18–20]. 
In recent years, multiple studies have confirmed that D-dimer is elevated in AAD, and several stud-
ies have assessed its diagnostic value for AAD. 
However, at a defined cutoff value, the sensitivity and specificity of D-dimer for the diagnosis of AAD 
have been reported to vary, possibly due to differ -ent assay methods used in different studies. Gen-
erally, when a cutoff value of 0.5 µg/ml is used, the sensitivity and negative predictive value can 
reach almost 100% with a specificity of 54–68.6% 
[5, 9], and the specificity can be increased to 73% 
when the cutoff value is 0.626 µg/ml [6]. Shimony 
et al. [21] recently performed a meta-analysis of D-dimer to diagnose AAD and found that at a cut-
off value of 0.5 µg/ml, the sensitivity and negative 
predictive value were 0.97 and 0.96, respectively. However, the specificity and positive predictive val-
ue were low, 0.56 and 0.60, respectively. Moreover, 
the negative likelihood ratio showed an excellent discriminative ability (0.06), whereas the posi-
tive likelihood ratio did not (2.43). They conclud-
ed that a plasma D-dimer level < 0.5 µg/ml was 
a  useful screening tool to identify patients who 
do not have AAD. Therefore, the plasma D-dimer level may thus be used to identify subjects who 
are unlikely to benefit from further aortic imaging. 
Our results were consistent with this study, sug-gesting that the cutoff value of D-dimer < 0.5 µg/ 
ml, which is widely used for excluding PE [22], is 
also applicable for the exclusion of AAD. Howev-
er, the D-dimer level in patients with AAD is not 
always elevated, and several studies [23, 24], in-cluding ours, have observed this phenomenon. 
Hazui et al. [25] proposed that younger patients 
with a short dissection length and a thrombosed 
false lumen without ulcer-like projections may 
have false-negative D-dimer results. Therefore, 
patients who present classic characteristics of AAD but have a negative D-dimer test should re-
ceive further aortic imaging.
Due to its non-specific characteristics, an ele-
vated D-dimer level is also seen in patients with 
other morbidities such as PE, AMI, UA, and other diseases. Therefore, further investigation is neces-
sary to clarify whether D-dimer tests can differ -
entiate AAD from other diseases that presented 
with elevated D-dimer levels. Suzuki et al. [26] re-
ported that when the cutoff level was 1.6 µg/ml, 
D-dimer was a useful tool for differentiating AAD 
from AMI, angina or other ischemic heart diseases Table II. Diagnostic performance of D-dimer at the cutoff level of 0.5 µg/ml

Admission D-dimer testing for differentiating acute aortic dissection from other causes of acute chest pain
Arch Med Sci 3, April / 2017 595within the first 6 h, and when the cutoff value was 
0.8 or 0.9 µg/ml, the D-dimer level could differ -
entiate AAD from AMI [27]. Sakamoto et al. [28] 
also found that a cutoff value of 0.5 µg/ml was 
effective for distinguishing AAD and PE from AMI, with a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 90%. 
Although their results were mostly consistent with ours, the cutoff values used in these studies were 
different and the obtained D-dimer levels in vari-ous causes of acute chest pain varied greatly. One 
possible explanation for this variation was the 
different measurement equipment and the test 
strip used. Therefore, a standard and unified de-
tection protocol may improve the heterogeneity of 
measurement, making the detection value more 
reliable. 
Additionally, the D-dimer level was elevated in 
both AAD and PE patients, with no significant dif-
ference in our study, consistent with the findings 
of Sakamoto et al. [28] and Eggebrecht et al. [6]. 
Given the high mortality of the two morbidities, 
immediate contrast CT imaging or tissue Doppler imaging [29] may be good choices to differentiate 
AAD from PE.
In the setting of AMI/UA, rupture of atheroscle-
rotic plaques causes thrombopoiesis and activates 
fibrin degradation, leading to D-dimer formation. 
Therefore, D-dimer is elevated in patients with 
AMI/UA but not in patients with stable angina 
and healthy controls [30, 31]. Although the D-di-
mer level does not directly reflect the degree of 
myocardial damage, it has been confirmed that 
an elevated D-dimer level is a strong predictor of 
mortality in patients with AMI/UA [32, 33]. There-
fore, the D-dimer level is not only a useful tool for 
the differentiation of diagnoses, but it also plays 
an important role in the prognostic evaluation for some cardiovascular diseases. 
Some limitations of the present study need 
to be addressed. First, although our study shows 
good prediction for AAD with the D-dimer level 
at the cutoff of 0.5 µg/ml, the specificity is low 
(56.8%). Indeed, D-dimer as a diagnostic biomark-
er of AAD did have some limitations due to the 
relatively high false positive rate. Therefore, for 
patients with a  D-dimer level > 0.5 µg/ml, the 
D-dimer level should be combined with other di-
agnostic tests, especially imaging tests, for an ac-
curate diagnosis of AAD. Second, the small sample 
size of PE patients may affect the statistical power. 
Furthermore, the difference in D-dimer levels was 
not evaluated between patients with ST-segment elevation AMI and non-ST-segment elevation AMI. 
Therefore, further large, prospective, multi-center 
studies are needed.
In conclusion, the D-dimer level within 24 h 
after symptom onset might be helpful for differ -
entiating patients with suspected AAD from other 
causes of chest pain.Acknowledgments
