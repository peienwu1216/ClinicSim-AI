Introduction: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is one of the leading causes of
death from cardiovascular diseases worldwide, with ST-segment elevationmyocardial infarction (STEMI) representing a severe form of ACS that exhibits
high prevalence and mortality rates. This study proposes a new method for
accurately diagnosing STEMI and categorizing the infarction area in detail, basedon 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) data using a deep learning-based arti ﬁcial
intelligence (AI) algorithm.
Methods: Utilizing an ECG database consisting of 888 myocardial infarction (MI)
patients, this study enhanced the generalization ability of the AI model throughﬁve-fold cross-validation. The developed ST-segment elevation (STE) detector
accurately identi ﬁed STE across all 12 leads, which is a crucial indicator for the
clinical ECG diagnosis of STEMI. This detector was employed in the AI model todifferentiate between STEMI and non-ST-segment elevation myocardialinfarction (NSTEMI).
Results: In the process of distinguishing between STEMI and NSTEMI, the average
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was 0.939, andthe area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) was 0.977, demonstratingsigni ﬁcant results. Furthermore, this detector exhibited the ability to accurately
differentiate between various infarction territories in the ECG, including anterior
myocardial infarction (AMI), inferior myocardial infarction (IMI), lateral myocardialinfarction (LMI), and suspected left main disease.
Discussion: These results suggest that integrating clinical domains into AI
technology for ECG diagnosis can play a crucial role in the rapid treatment
and improved prognosis of STEMI patients. This study provides an innovativeOPEN ACCESS

1 Introduction
Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a very common cause of
morbidity and mortality in the United States, with an estimated1.5 million hospitalizations and costs of more than USD 150 billionannually, according to the American Heart Association ( Kolansky,
2009 ). ACS includes unstable angina, non-ST-segment elevation
myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST-segment elevation
myocardial infarction (STEMI). The pathogenesis of acutemyocardial infarction involves rupture or erosion of anatherosclerotic plaque ( Arbustini et al., 1999 ), and NSTEMI
occurs in the setting of partial occlusion of the culprit coronaryartery ( Bhat et al., 2016 ). In contrast, STEMI is caused by complete
occlusion of the culprit coronary artery. Thus, STEMI is moresymptomatic, has a more rapid disease progression, and a higher
mortality rate than NSTEMI ( Rodríguez-Padial et al., 2021 ;Meyers
et al., 2021 ). As such, STEMI is one of the major cardiovascular
diseases with high prevalence and mortality ( Benjamin et al., 2018 ),
and timely diagnosis of STEMI is critical to reducing the risk ofsudden death through prompt treatment ( Murray et al., 2015 ).
Coronary angiography (CAG) is the gold standard diagnosticmethod for STEMI ( Wu et al., 2022 ). Percutaneous coronary
intervention (PCI), performed through this procedure, is an
effective treatment that limits the infarction size after a
myocardial infarction and reduces the risk of complications andheart failure ( Mehta et al., 2010 ;Bulluck et al., 2016 ). Additionally,
biomarkers, cardiac imaging technologies, and electrocardiographicmethods, used as auxiliary diagnostic tools, play a crucial role indiagnosing myocardial infarction ( Thygesen et al., 2012 ). Among
emergency treatment options, non-invasive ECG is the most cost-effective and irreplaceable method, allowing for continuous and
remote monitoring ( Siontis et al., 2021 ). Continuous ECG
monitoring provides useful prognostic information anddetermines reperfusion or re-occlusion status ( Thygesen et al.,
2018 ). Therefore, it is an essential diagnostic step for suspected
patients in the ambulance or hospital. Furthermore, a 12-lead ECGcan be used to understand the pathogenesis of MI better and toaccurately determine the location of the occluded coronary arteryand myocardial infarction. Speci ﬁc ECG leads can re ﬂect various
locations of the heart ’s electrical activity and can distinguish
different types of MI according to the area of myocardial necrosis(Meek and Morris, 2002 ). For example, ST-segment elevations
(STEs) in leads V1, V2, V3, and V4 suggest anterior wallmyocardial infarction (AMI), while STEs in leads II, III, and aVFsuggest inferior wall myocardial infarction (IMI). Considering thesefactors, the 12-lead ECGs serve as the standard diagnostic tool fordiagnosing ACS. In the clinical setting, in addition to the distinction
between STEMI and NSTEMI, ECGs of STEMI patients require
rapid and accurate interpretation. However, interpreting a STEMIfrom ECG images is challenging for ambulance paramedics,emergency physicians, and sometimes cardiologists ( Debrabant
et al., 2021 ). In previous ECG arti ﬁcial intelligence (AI) studies,
signiﬁcant efforts were made to enhance the accuracy of STEMI and
other abnormality diagnoses by leveraging deep learning for 12-leadECG analysis ( Liu et al., 2021 ;Ribeiro et al., 2020 ). These model
designs are supported by evidence that AI techniques based on deeplearning not only compete with but often surpass human
performance in many areas, such as medical diagnostics, image
and speech recognition, natural language processing, strategic gameplaying, algorithm discovery, and structure prediction ofbiomolecular interactions ( Silver et al., 2016 ;Brown et al., 2020 ;
Mankowitz et al., 2023 ;Kaufmann et al., 2023 ;Abramson et al.,
2024 ). Consequently, those studies attempting to diagnose heart
diseases have demonstrated that these techniques yield meaningfulresults in practical 12-lead ECG settings. However, these existing
studies have only conducted experiments on 1-dimensional digital
ECG sequence data directly obtained from devices and not ECGimages derived from printed papers, although printed versions areoften considered the universal format for ECGs. In contrast, theliterature on conventional image processing techniques for ECGsfrom printed papers includes numerous efforts to digitize theseimages into sequences, apply geometric transformations, andrecognize speci ﬁc patterns ( Lence et al., 2023 ;Badilini et al.,
2005 ;Waits and Soliman, 2017 ). However, most of these
approaches struggle with noise sources such as printing errors,
poor skin-electrode contact, and other interferences, resulting ininsufﬁcient accuracy and performance that is not competitive with
human professionals, such as emergency medicine residents orcardiologists. Given the complexity of these noises and the real-world contexts, the data-driven, end-to-end learning capabilities ofdeep learning-based AI are essential. The conventional deep learning
approach to perform STEMI classi ﬁcation is illustrated in Figure 1A .
To our knowledge, no study has yet demonstrated the clinicalsigniﬁcance of interpreting and classifying STEMI through deep
learning in 12-lead ECG images. This study presents a clinically-grounded and interpretable AI model for STEMI ECG analysis. ThisAI model aims to distinguish between STEMI and NSTEMI andaccurately predict infarction territory on STEMI ECGs, serving as anauxiliary tool for clinicians to facilitate rapid diagnosis and
treatment. Figure 1B illustrates the structure of the proposed
model. Initially, it uses a deep learning-based algorithm to detectST-segment elevations in each lead of the 12-lead ECG imagethrough supervised learning ( Rashidi et al., 2019 ), providing
clinical evidence for further analysis. It then distinguishesbetween STEMI and NSTEMI and, if classi ﬁed as STEMI,
identi ﬁes the infarction territory based on the detected STEs. The
detailed process is provided in the Materials and Methods section.
The Experiments and Results section evaluates the effectiveness of
our approach and compares its performance to conventional deeplearning approaches, illustrated in Figure 1A .

2 Materials and methods
2.1 Data collection
2.1.1 Dataset
A standard supine 12-lead ECG of 25 mm/s and 10 mm/mV was
used. We selected the ﬁrst ECG for patients with MI when theyvisited the emergency department for the MI ECG. The Philips ECG
system (Philips Medical System, PageWriter TC30, TC70) was usedfor the baseline ECG data. The dataset consists of ECG images, ofwhich the ECG region consists of a grid-shaped background and asignal portion, as shown in Figure 2A . The signal part of the ECG
area comprises thin lines. We collected ECG images of 888 MIpatients, including 677 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction

(STEMI) patients and 211 non-ST-segment elevation myocardial
infarction (NSTEMI) patients, recorded in the emergencydepartment of Kyungpook National University Hospital fromJanuary 2011 to December 2019. Table 1 provides the
distribution of samples for STEMI and NSTEMI datasets. Itshould be noted that the total number of samples for infarction
territory (872) exceeds the number of STEMI samples (677). This
discrepancy is because a single STEMI patient can have multiplecoronary occlusions. The KNUH Institutional Review Boardapproved the use of this dataset (2020-12-022-011).
2.1.2 Data annotation
This study performed model learning using a supervised
learning approach. For the 12-lead ECG images, the STEMI and
NSTEMI diagnostic labeling was classi ﬁed based on medical records
and the clinical judgment of physicians. In addition to ST-segmentelevation, we annotated areas of mild ST elevation (i.e., lesser STE)to consider these abnormalities as potential indicators to distinguishSTEMI and NSTEMI cases in ECGs. To generate ground truthlabels, human encoders manually annotated the STE (a box wherethe ST segment rises more than 1 mm, including the QRS complex)and lesser STE (a box where the ST segment rises 1 mm or lesser,
including the QRS complex) for each lead of the 12-lead ECG images
using a Python package called labelImg ( GitHub, 2015 )(Figure 2B ).
The criteria for ST elevation at the J point was based on theAmerican College of Cardiology/American Heart AssociationSTEMI guidelines, de ﬁned as an elevation of 1 mm or more
above the baseline at the J point. All labels and annotations inthe STEMI and NSTEMI ECG annotation dataset were performedusing the gold standard of three board-certi ﬁed cardiologists who
agreed on the annotation placement through discussion. This study
was retrospective and did not require informed consent.
2.2 Data preprocessing
The original ECG data were available in printed papers, and the
scanned ECG region had a resolution of 1,228 × 2,460. While we
used 12-lead ECGs, there are 13 different ﬁgures because lead II (L2)
has one more recording of longer duration, whereas the otherchannels have only short recordings, as shown in Figure 2A . For
simplicity, we split the long L2 recording into four evenly dividedsubregions and detected ST elevations separately in each subregion.We did not use other clinical information, such as sex or age, whichcan be obtained from the ECG reports.
2.3 Model architecture
In this study, we ﬁrst detect regions of STE and lesser STE
patterns from the given ECG, and two inference procedures wereconducted based on the detection result: STEMI classi ﬁcation and
prediction of infarction territory. The brief architecture of the modelis illustrated in Figure 1 .
2.3.1 Detection of ST-segment elevations
As described in subsection 2.2 , the only preprocessing required
is the manual separation of image regions for each ECG lead,performed once before data processing begins. These clipped
images from the original ECG serve as input for our detectormodels. To detect STEs, we trained a Faster R-CNN model ( Ren
et al., 2016 ) with ResNet-50 ( He et al., 2016 ) serving as the backbone
network. Faster R-CNN is an object detection algorithm and its
Region Proposal Network (RPN) is responsible for generating region
proposals for detections. The algorithm begins by processing theinput image through a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) togenerate feature maps, which capture important visual informationfrom the image. Next, Faster R-CNN employs a RPN to suggestpotential object locations. The RPN predicts the likelihood of anobject being present in each proposed region and provides thecoordinates of the corresponding bounding boxes. During this
process, Faster R-CNN performs bounding box regression to
reﬁne these proposals, aiming to accurately predict the locations
of objects by minimizing the difference between the predictedbounding boxes and the actual ground truth boxes. Finally, foreach re ﬁned bounding box, the algorithm predicts the object class,
resulting in the ﬁnal detection output. Through this integrated
approach, Faster R-CNN achieves high accuracy and speed inobject detection. Thus, Faster R-CNN is notable for its ef ﬁcient
region proposal mechanism and its focus on accurately predicting
both the locations and classes of objects within an image. As wedescribed earlier, we utilized pre-trained model weights of ResNet-50 for constructing the convolutional feature maps of the FasterR-CNN, instead of random initialization. In this study, the RPN ofFaster R-CNN applies a 3 × 3 convolutional ﬁlter to generate region
proposals using anchor boxes of various sizes. ResNet-50, thebackbone network for Faster R-CNN, consists of 50 layers and
employs residual (shortcut) connections that skip over one or more
layers. During the training phase of Faster R-CNN, ground-truthbounding boxes of STEs and lesser STEs, annotated by cardiologists,are provided as labels. Using these annotations, the model is trained,enabling it to generate accurate bounding boxes during inference.During bounding box regression of Faster R-CNN ( Ren et al., 2016 ),
bounding box information is encoded as shown in Equation 1 .

overlapping bounding boxes that are not semantically distinct, to
reﬁne these results, we additionally apply soft non-maximal
suppression (soft NMS) ( Bodla et al., 2017 ). We determined
optimal threshold values for soft NMS ﬁltering by systematically
evaluating Intersection over Union (IoU) and score threshold valuesfrom 0.0 to 1.0 in increments of 0.1. Finally, an IoU threshold of
0.5 and a score threshold of 0.7 were selected as they provided the
best results on the validation dataset. The procedure of the STEdetection is illustrated in Figure 3 . Notably, our approach can
directly identify STE and lesser STE regions from scanned ECGpaper images, eliminating the need for additional preprocessingsteps like grid removal or smoothing.
2.3.2 Classi ﬁcation of STEMI
For automated classi ﬁcation of STEMI, various methods exist to
encode information detected from an image. In this study, weemployed the following information encodings: (1) the counts ofdetected STEs and lesser STEs from the given image; (2) the countsof detected STEs for each lead; (3) the counts of detected STEs andlesser STEs for each lead; (4) the presence of detected STEs and lesserSTEs from the given image; (5) the presence of detected STEs foreach lead; (6) the presence of detected STEs and lesser STEs for each
lead. We denote these six feature encoding schemes, as shown in
Table 2 . For example, if four STEs and one lesser STE are detected at
theﬁrst lead, and two lesser STEs are at the second lead, then the
representations will be: (Image-Detailed Count) [4, 3]; (Lead-STECount) [4, 0, 0, ..., 0]; (Lead-Detailed Count) [4, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, ..., 0];
(Image-Detailed Presence) [1, 1]; (Lead-STE Presence) [1, 0, 0, ...,
0]; and (Lead-Detailed Presence) [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0]. For these six
cases, classi ﬁcation performances are separately evaluated in the
results for comparison. As a classi ﬁcation model, weighted ensemble
models ( Erickson et al., 2020 ) were trained to classify STEMI from
the STE detection result. Although we tested classi ﬁers such as
Support Vector Machines and Random Forests, the weightedensemble model consistently outperformed the others. Therefore,we selected the weighted ensemble model for STEMI classi ﬁcation.
The weighted ensemble model consists of k-nearest neighbors,LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, RandomForest, ExtraTrees, and
Multi-layer Perceptron. Comparisons of the encodings are
presented in Table 5 in the Results subsection.
2.3.3 Prediction of infarction territory
In this subsection, we describe a method for identifying
infarction territory in patients with STEMI. Using detectionresults of STEs on 12 leads as features, we used a weightedensemble model to predict vascular problems. The areas of
infarction were classi ﬁed into four regions: anterior, lateral,
inferior, and suspected left main disease. We referenced theclinical criteria in Table 3 to identify infarction territory based on
ECG ﬁndings.
We applied these clinical criteria to the AI model, conducting a
process in which the STE Detector predicted infarction territory
based on anticipated annotations. The predicted results were thencompared and analyzed for similarity with the target labels
classi ﬁed by the actual infarctio n territories. A classi ﬁer using
weighted ensembles learns the relationships between theencodings of detected STEs (and lesser STEs) and the targetterritories.3 Experiments and results
3.1 Experiment setup
To implement the proposed system, we used deep learning
libraries and frameworks such as AutoGluon, MMDetection, and
PyTorch ( Erickson et al., 2020 ;Chen et al., 2019 ;Paszke et al., 2019 ).
Speci ﬁcally, we used MMDetection for Faster R-CNN
implementation, and PyTorch for the baseline models, includingResNet-50, Inception-ResNet-v2 ( Szegedy et al., 2017 ), and
ConvNeXt ( Liu et al., 2022 ). For the classi ﬁcation of STEMI in
section 2.3.2 , we used AutoGluon ’s implementations of LightGBM,
CatBoost, XGBoost, RandomForest, ExtraTrees, and Multi-layerPerceptron. A computing server with three NVIDIA A10 Tensor
Core GPUs with 24 GB memory is used in the experiments. The total
training time for a model is approximately 9 h on the server, and a 5-fold cross-validation process, which takes around 45 h. Forinference, processing a single ECG sample takes about500 milliseconds. All performance metrics are obtained byaveraging the results from 5-fold cross-validation. To comparethe performance of the proposed method with end-to-end AImodels consisting of a single classi ﬁcation stage (i.e., without
explicit detection of STEs), we ﬁne-tuned deep learning models
such as ResNet-50, Inception-ResNet-v2, and ConvNeXt using theprovided ECG dataset. The pre-training was conducted using theMicrosoft COCO dataset ( Lin et al., 2014 ), a large-scale dataset
widely used for object detection and segmentation tasks. Thelearning rate was set to 0.001 for 100 epochs of training, and anearly stopping criterion was applied to avoid over ﬁtting.
3.2 Results
In this subsection, we present performance evaluations for the
detection of STE, the classi ﬁcation of STEMI, and the identi ﬁcation
of infarction territories.
In each ECG image, there were 16 subregions corresponding to
the leads. In each subregion, the detector attempts to generate
bounding boxes for STE or lesser STE patterns. The average
performance of detecting ST-segment elevations and theirstandard deviations is presented in Table 4 . The experiment was
conducted using a 5-fold cross-validation technique. Sensitivityscores are slightly higher than precision, which is bene ﬁcial for
the detector, as false negatives are generally riskier in medicalsituations.
Table 5 describes the STEMI detection performances with
various STE encoding schemes. As our initial assumption that
minor abnormalities, such as lesser STE, can also provide a hintto STEMI, feature encodings with both STE and lesser STEoutperformed other encodings. However, the superiorperformance of Presence encodings over Count encodings was
difﬁcult to anticipate and requires further interpretation. This
outcome can be interpreted from the following perspective. Inthe context of STEMI classi ﬁcation, the rich information
provided by Count encodings might not be as critical because
clinical decisions are generally unaffected by whether there areﬁve or six STEs. Instead, the simplicity of the feature space in
Presence encodings offers an advantage over the richness of Count
Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org 05Kim et al. 10.3389/fphys.2024.1462847
encodings for training AI models, as a more complex feature space
typically requires more data samples to achieve similargeneralization performance. In this experiment, large-scaletraining data were unavailable; therefore, for the STEMIclassi ﬁcation task, Presence encodings may be more effective
than Count encodings. As a result, the Lead-Detailed Presenceencoding proved to be the most effective encoding for STE
detection in the STEMI classi ﬁcation task.
To compare our approach with other deep learning models, we
conducted ﬁne-tuning procedures for ResNet-50, Inception-
ResNet-v2, and ConvNeXt and evaluated their performance onSTEMI detection. These models perform end-to-end learning andone-stage STEMI detection, meaning they do not explicitly detectSTE or lesser STE regions but instead provide a direct decision forthe given image. In contrast, our approach consists of a two-stageprocess: explicit detection of STEs, followed by STEMI classi ﬁcation
based on the information from the detected STEs. By explicitlydetecting STEs, our model incorporates expert knowledge fromcardiologists during the model construction phase, resulting insuperior performance compared to one-stage deep learningmodels, as shown in Table 6 . Furthermore, in the inference
phase, our model provides explicit detection results to assist
medical clinicians in their decision-making process, enhancing
the explainability of the model and avoiding the limitations of ablack-box approach.
Based on the STE and lesser STE detection results, we trained
and tested weighted ensemble models, and Table 5 illustrates the
average and standard deviations of performances obtained from 5-fold cross-validation. As shown in Table 7 , the performance of
suspected LM prediction was much worse than predictions of otherTABLE 3 Clinical criteria for identifying infarction territories on the ECG.

main disease has much fewer samples than the others, as describedinTable 1 . We also visualized the images to enhance our
understanding of these experimental results, as shown in Figure 4 .
4 Discussion
STEMI is classi ﬁed as the most lethal form of coronary artery
disease. It is caused by a complete or near-complete blockage of acoronary artery that supplies blood to the heart muscle, which canlead to extensive damage to the myocardial tissue. Rapid andaccurate diagnosis of STEMI can signi ﬁcantly improve patient
survival and recovery. However, inappropriate and false-positiveactivation in the cardiac catheterization laboratory was reported tobe as high as 2.7% and 20%, respectively ( Rokos et al., 2010 ), which
was highlighted as a major problem in the diagnostic and treatment
process. Moreover, the uneven distribution of diagnostic levels andmedical resources increases the possibility of misdiagnosis andmissed diagnosis of STEMI, a major obstacle in providingpatients with optimal diagnostic and treatment strategies.Electrocardiogram is an objective, cost-effective, and widely usedtool for diagnosing STEMI. An ECG records the electrical activity of
the heart, which allows for identifying signs of coronary arteryocclusion and myocardial damage. However, ECG interpretation ishighly dependent on the experience and judgment of the physician,which can lead to a lack of diagnostic consistency, a time-consumingand labor-intensive process.
An ECG-based STEMI diagnosis using arti ﬁcial intelligence
technology represents a signi ﬁcant step forward in addressing these
issues. AI can learn patterns from large datasets and diagnose STEMI
quickly and accurately based on these patterns. This is important inreducing the door-to-balloon (D2B) time, with shorter D2B timeassociated with lower in-hospital mortality and 6-month mortality(Nallamothu et al., 2015 ). Reducing D2B time helps to minimize
damage to the heart muscle, increase the possibility of recovery ofcardiac function, and improve long-term survival. The results of thisstudy suggest that AI, especially CNN deep learning models, can be
effectively used to analyze each lead by detection in a 12-lead ECG.
We built an ECG database of 888 MI patients in a real hospitalemergency department. We used 5-fold cross-validation in allexperiments to prevent the model from over ﬁtting to the training
data and improve its generalization ability. We were able to use thedata ef ﬁciently because all data samples can be used for training andTABLE 6 Comparison to other deep learning models.

validation. In addition, by evaluating the model using multiple data
sets, we increased the stability and reliability of the model, as the
performance of the model does not depend on a speci ﬁcp a r to ft h e
data. Our STE detector accurately detected STE and lesser STE with anaverage mAP of 0.76 in each of the 12 leads. When applied to the AImodel, it showed high classi ﬁcation performance with an average
AUROC of 0.939 and AUPRC of 0.977 for STEMI and NSTEMI,respectively. In addition, the ECG showed a signi ﬁcantly high
sensitivity for the detection of anterior MI, recording an averageACC (0.91), SEN (0.94), SPEC (0.89), F1-score (0.92), and AUROC
(0.95). Moreover, the AI model demonstrated accurate performance
even for lateral MI and inferior MI, which are more challenging tointerpret on ECG than anterior MI. The average scores were ACC(0.89, 0.95), SEN (0.87, 0.90), SPEC (0.90, 0.96), F1-score (0.81, 0.84),and AUROC (0.92, 0.96). Even for the relatively infrequent suspectedleft main disease, it achieved high performance with ACC (0.92), SEN(0.76), SPEC (0.93), and AUROC (0.83).
The main contribution of this study is to demonstrate that our AI
model excels in classifying STEMI and NSTEMI and identifying
infarct locations. Previous studies reported that the classi ﬁcation
performance of AI for STEMI had average AUROC, ACC, SEN,and SPEC values of 0.99, 0.98, 0.95, and 0.99, respectively, highlightingthe superiority of AI models in classifying STEMI and NSTEMI ECGs(Wu et al., 2022 ;Chen et al., 2022 ;Zhao et al., 2020 ). However, from a
patient care support perspective, the decisions made by AI did notprovide clear evidence for ST segment elevation, a critical indicator for
STEMI diagnosis in reliable ECGs. To address this issue, we utilized an
ST segment elevation (STE) detector to provide clinically interpretableECG analyses to clinicians, demonstrating the detector ’s excellent
performance in identifying STE and lesser STE across 12 ECG leads.Notably, while our STE detection based on clinical guidelines had the
AUROC, ACC, SEN, and SPEC values (0.939, 0.895, 0.894, 0.897)
relatively lower than those of previous AI models, it improved the
reliability of AI judgments by effectively distinguishing STEMI andNSTEMI at a level comparable to that of cardiologists ( Wu et al., 2022 ;
Zhao et al., 2020 ) and visualized the ability to classify infarct locations
similarly to cardiologists ( Figure 4 ). Additionally, it provides more
detailed information about the anatomical key locations of STsegment elevation myocardial infarction, which differentiates ourstudy from previous research.
The signi ﬁcance of this work goes beyond the advancement of
AI technology. We explored ways to improve the depth and accuracyof clinical information that AI models can provide through ECGanalysis. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the potential ofmedical evidence-based AI developed through close collaborationbetween AI developers and healthcare professionals to be usefullyapplied in real clinical settings. Such collaboration will make AItechnology a clinically interpretable and reliable tool for healthcare
professionals, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.
However, several obstacles need to be overcome before the
results of this study can be applied to actual clinical practice.First, there is a need for data standardization between hospitals.It is dif ﬁcult to guarantee the compatibility of AI tools, as the data
format or structure varies depending on the type or manufacturer ofthe ECG machine used in each hospital, making it dif ﬁcult to apply
AI tools to the clinical ﬁeld. It is necessary to ensure technical
compatibility through standardization of data between hospitals,
and system integration between medical institutions andmanufacturers is required for this. Secondly, enhancing theunderstanding of AI technology among medical personnel

Frontiers in Physiology frontiersin.org 08Kim et al. 10.3389/fphys.2024.1462847
presents a signi ﬁcant challenge. Utilizing these tools can be dif ﬁcult
for those with limited knowledge of AI. An initial solution mightinvolve carefully considering the UI design of these tools toaccommodate non-AI experts better. However, providingadditional promotion and education is crucial for medicalpersonnel to use AI tools effectively ( Kim et al., 2024 ). Such
measures will encourage the adoption of AI tools across multiple
centers and promote a safer and more standardized medicalenvironment. Third, AI-based ECG diagnostic algorithms mustbe rigorously validated across diverse racial groups to addressand minimize racial biases and ensure fairness and accuracy.Fourth, the classi ﬁcation performance of AI should be thoroughly
assessed, including comparisons with a control group without ahistory of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This evaluation should
extend to detecting early phases of STEMI by including lesser ST
elevations alongside signi ﬁcant ones, Additionally, considering rare
cases that may be observed in STEMI, such as tall T waves and Qwave abnormalities, would enhance the clinical effectiveness of theproposed STEMI classi ﬁcation AI model, which requires further
exploration. Fifth, while this study ’s retrospective single-center
design has provided initial insights, its generalizability is limited.Despite rigorous internal validation through cross-validation,
additional studies involving external validation in varied settings
are essential to enhance reliability and applicability. Nevertheless,this study employed ECG machines commonly used in clinicalpractice and favored digitized ECG images over raw data toimprove the generalizability of the ﬁndings. However, there is
still potential to further enhance the method ’s performance by
leveraging the extensive information available from the rawdigital signals recorded by these devices. As a part of our future
work, we aim to explore data augmentation using generative models
that facilitate domain transfers between raw signals and printedECG images. Additionally, we will consider detecting other visualcues, such as peaks or QRS complexes, to enrich the feature space(Ciusdel et al., 2020 ). For instance, heartbeat information derived
from peak detection could be incorporated into the feature vector orused to calculate additional features, such as the STE rationormalized by cardiac cycles. Furthermore, although we
measured the performance of the methods using cross-validation,
there remains a need to investigate the effects of hyper-parametervariations. To gain a deeper understanding and improve robustnessto hyper-parameters, we plan to conduct an ablation study. Lastly,we will perform experiments to thoroughly test the robustness of theproposed model, including its behavior in edge cases. For instance,in some cases, an ECG plot may overlap with the region of anotherlead, causing two signal lines to merge or become dif ﬁcult to
distinguish. It is crucial to observe how the model responds to
such abnormal cases to ensure its applicability in real-world scenarios.
In conclusion, effective use of AI for ECG interpretation
requires technical development, a supportive institutionalstructure, and an educational system. This integrated approachwill guide future research directions in this study and play a crucialrole in expanding the use of AI in ECG analysis. Such
advancements will aid medical professionals by providing direct
support in clinical settings, boosting their con ﬁdence in the
p e r f o r m a n c eo fA I .T h er o l eo fA Ia sac o - p i l o ti nf a c i l i t a t i n gquick and accurate diagnoses can be critical in saving lives,especially in emergencies. Sinc e the direct diagnosis is still
made after review by a cardiologist, patients will be free fromanxiety and prejudice about AI. This is expected to make asigniﬁcant contribution to the resolution of the uneven
distribution of medical resources and the improvement ofpatient outcomes.
5 Conclusion
The present study evaluates an AI model for STEMI diagnosis
and identifying infarction territories from 12-lead ECG images,integrating AI and clinical guidance. Two signi ﬁcant bene ﬁts are
obtained by explicitly guiding the detection of ST-segment
elevations.
First, it addresses the challenge of insuf ﬁcient training data.
Without clinical guidance, the model would struggle to identifyeffective features from large-scale data, which are often scarce andexpensive to acquire and annotate in medical data analysis. Themodel can focus on relevant features even with a limited dataset byincorporating clinical evidence during the training phase.
Second, the model offers explainability, aiding clinical
practitioners, including cardiologists, in understanding its
diagnostic process. By providing clinical evidence during theinference phase, clinicians can make prompt decisions in urgentsituations and evaluate the reliability of the model ’s outputs, such as
STEMI classi ﬁcation and identifying infarction territories.
The study demonstrates the model ’s effectiveness in diagnosing
STEMI and identifying infarction territories. The proposed modelperforms superiorly compared to conventional end-to-end learning
AI approaches.
In summary, this study highlights the potential of AI models
enhanced with clinical evidence and developed through closecollaboration between AI developers and cardiology specialists.Such implementation ensures that AI technology becomes aclinically interpretable and reliable tool, ultimately improvingpatient outcomes.
