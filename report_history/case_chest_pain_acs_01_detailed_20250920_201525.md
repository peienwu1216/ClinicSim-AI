## 報告內容

**Diagnostic Analysis Report**

**1. Questioning Technique Assessment**

The student's questioning technique is generally systematic and thorough, covering essential components such as the location of pain, duration, radiation, quality, and severity. However, there are some areas for improvement:

* The student could have explored more extensively on the patient's medical history, including cardiovascular risk factors, medication use, and allergies.
* Additionally, the questioning process could be more focused and targeted, rather than being too broad and open-ended.

**2. Clinical Decision-Making Analysis**

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the clinical decision-making process in this scenario. They have identified key symptoms and risk factors, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and cold sweats, which are consistent with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However:

* The student could have considered other potential causes for the patient's symptoms, such as pulmonary embolism or pneumonia.
* Further questioning is needed to clarify the patient's medical history, including cardiovascular risk factors and medication use.

**3. Knowledge Application Assessment**

The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of ACS, including the importance of ECG in ruling out ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However:

* The student could have explored more extensively on the patient's medical history to identify potential cardiovascular risk factors.
* Further questioning is needed to clarify the patient's medication use and allergies.

**4. Improvement Recommendations**

Based on the RAG system provided, I recommend the following:

* Further training on the importance of a thorough patient history, including cardiovascular risk factors and medication use.
* Practice in identifying key symptoms and risk factors for ACS.
* Familiarization with the diagnostic criteria for STEMI and unstable angina.

**5. Grading Summary**

I would give this scenario an overall score of 7 out of 10. The student has demonstrated a good understanding of the clinical decision-making process, but there are areas for improvement in terms of questioning technique and knowledge application.

**Additional Recommendations**

To improve their skills, I recommend that the student:

* Review the RAG system provided to better understand the diagnostic criteria for ACS.
* Practice with additional scenarios to build their confidence and competence in diagnosing and managing patients with chest pain.
* Seek feedback from peers and mentors to refine their questioning technique and clinical decision-making process.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, this student has demonstrated a good understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), but there are areas for improvement in terms of questioning technique and knowledge application. With further training and practice, I am confident that they will become a competent clinician in diagnosing and managing patients with chest pain.
