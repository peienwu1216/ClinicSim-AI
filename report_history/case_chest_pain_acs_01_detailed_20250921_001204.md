## 報告內容

**OSCE Analysis Report**

**1. Questioning Performance Evaluation**

The student's questioning technique is characterized by an initial expression of pain and discomfort, followed by a clear description of the symptoms. The student effectively conveys their concerns and seeks reassurance from me. However, the questioning process could be improved by asking more specific and targeted questions to clarify the patient's symptoms.

Strengths: The student demonstrates empathy and concern for the patient's well-being, and is able to clearly articulate the patient's symptoms.

Weaknesses: The questioning process could be more structured and focused on clarifying the patient's symptoms.

**2. Clinical Decision-Making Analysis**

The student's clinical decision-making process appears to be driven by a recognition of the patient's severe chest pain and potential heart-related concerns. However, further evaluation is needed to determine if the student has identified key symptoms and risk factors.

Strengths: The student demonstrates an awareness of the patient's severity of illness and potential cardiac concerns.

Weaknesses: Further investigation is needed to confirm or rule out key diagnoses and identify potential risk factors.

**3. Knowledge Application Evaluation**

The student appears to have a basic understanding of acute chest pain diagnosis and treatment, but may not be familiar with standardized questioning protocols or specific diagnostic tests for cardiovascular disease.

Strengths: The student demonstrates a general awareness of cardiovascular disease and its symptoms.

Weaknesses: Further education is needed on standardized questioning protocols and specific diagnostic tests for cardiovascular disease.

**4. Improvement Recommendations**

Based on the RAG system provided, I recommend the following:

* Use standardized questioning protocols to clarify patient symptoms.
* Consider additional diagnostic testing (e.g., ECG, troponin) to confirm or rule out key diagnoses.
* Refer patients with suspected cardiac ischemia to a cardiologist for further evaluation and treatment.

Recommended learning resources:

* Review of cardiovascular disease diagnosis and treatment guidelines [引註 2]
* Familiarization with standardized questioning protocols [引註 1]

**5. Grading Conclusion**

Overall, the student demonstrates some understanding of acute chest pain diagnosis and treatment, but may benefit from further education on standardized questioning protocols and specific diagnostic tests for cardiovascular disease.

Grade: 6/10

Recommendations:

* Review cardiovascular disease diagnosis and treatment guidelines [引註 2]
* Practice using standardized questioning protocols [引註 1]
* Consider seeking additional guidance from a cardiologist or other healthcare professional.
